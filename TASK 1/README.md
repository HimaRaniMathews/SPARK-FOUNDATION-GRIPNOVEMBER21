# TASK 1 : To Explore Supervised Machine Learning <br>
<p>
We will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
